"""Verification directives — translate pipeline results into prompt actions.

When the verification pipeline detects issues, directives are structured
instructions injected into the LLM prompt that tell the agent *what to do*
about the failure. This is the bridge between "verification failed" and
"here's how to respond."

The directive pattern:
1. Verification runs (quick_judge binary checks + rule-based layers)
2. Any failed layer produces a structured directive tag
3. Directives are prepended to the user message in the LLM prompt
4. The agent's response is shaped by the directive, not just the raw query

Proven in cairn-demo E2E testing (2026-03-04):
- [BOUNDARY] on adversarial → 112ch boundary responses, no config leakage
- [CLARIFY] on vague → focused clarifying questions instead of guesses
- [BRIEF] on nonsense → 185-250ch acknowledgments, not 400+ essays

This is defense-in-depth: directives are the primary defense, prompt
hardening (instruction-refusal boundaries in system prompt) is the backup.

Meta-discourse safe-list pattern (learned from cairn-demo E2E 2026-03-06):
When using LLM-based safety classifiers (as opposed to regex-based), the
classifier will flag legitimate conversational patterns as manipulation
attempts unless explicitly trained to recognize them as safe. The following
categories need explicit SAFE carve-outs in any LLM safety judge prompt:
- Questions about the assistant's features, architecture, or philosophy
- Recall requests referencing prior conversation content
- Confidence/source challenges ("how sure are you?", "cite your sources")
- Meta-questions about reasoning process ("how did you decide?")
- Healthy skepticism or pushback on claims
- Preference recall ("what were my preferences?")
Production Cairn's regex-based safety avoids this by design (regexes match
structural injection patterns, not conversational semantics). But any future
LLM-based verifier in trcore should incorporate this safe-list pattern.

"""Binary LLM judge — lightweight yes/no confidence checks.

Asks the LLM a focused binary question with minimal token budget.
Used by verification layers to make real confidence decisions
before full inference runs.

Key properties:
- 4 tokens max output — just "yes" or "no"
- Temperature 0 — deterministic
- No context — just the verification question, so it's fast
- Fail-open — if Ollama hiccups, don't block the user

Proven in cairn-demo E2E testing (2026-03-04):
- Safety judge: 7/8 adversarial turns detected, 0 false positives on precise queries
- Intent judge: 8/8 vague turns flagged, 0 false negatives on clear queries
- Semantic judge: 8/8 nonsense turns flagged, 0 false negatives on substantive queries
- Latency: ~200-500ms per call on llama3.1:8b (4 output tokens)

    Fail-open: if the provider call fails for any reason, returns True
